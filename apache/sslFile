$ openssl genrsa -out server.key 1024
$ cat server.key

$ openssl rsa -in server.key -pubout

# Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
# This is a formal request asking a certificate authority to sign a certificate, and it contains the public 
# key of the entity requesting the certificate and information about the entity. The information becomes part of the
# certificate.

$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

# After a CSR is generated, you use it to sign your own certificate and/or send it to a public CA
# and ask him to sign the certificate.

# Signing your own certificate
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr \
> -signkey server.key -out server.crt

# Use the x509 command to examine the contents of the certificate you have created:
$ openssl x509 -text -in server.crt>


# Getting certificate signed by CA
# To get a publicly recognized certificate, you will send the generated CSR to a CA. The CA will
# collect payment, validate your organizationâ€™s identity, and issue a certificate.

# Allow SSLv3 and TLSv1 but not SSLv2
SSLProtocol All -SSLv2
